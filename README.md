Preservation project to help keep all 748 Xbox Live Arcade downloadable free-to-play games available for use.


## Purpose of the project

To provide an easy to navigate and use repository of all Xbox Live arcade free-to-play games, and hopefully soon themes, gamerpics and other DLC packages from the Xbox 360 marketplace after its closure on July 29th, 2024.

## Structure

All files are downloaded and compiled from reputable sources such as the Internet Archive and the Xbox360 subreddit using JDownloader to categorise and sort downloads for easy access.

## Download and Requirements
Download from one of the download options in the Releases tab, they go from A-C, D-H, I-N, O-S, T-W and X-Z.

As these files are extracted from the original Xbox 360  filetypes they are not as simple as a plug and play solution. As of now you will need a JTAG'ed or RGH modified 360 console OR access to the Xenia emulator.
